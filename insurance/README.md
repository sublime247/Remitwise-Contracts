## Usage Examples

### Creating a Policy

```rust
// Create a health insurance policy
let policy_id = insurance::create_policy(
    env,
    user_address,
    "Health Insurance".into(),
    "health".into(),
    100_0000000, // 100 XLM monthly
    10000_0000000, // 10,000 XLM coverage
);
```

### Paying Premium

```rust
// Pay monthly premium
let success = insurance::pay_premium(env, user_address, policy_id);
```

### Querying Policies

```rust
// Get all active policies
let active_policies = insurance::get_active_policies(env, user_address);

// Get total monthly premium
let total_premium = insurance::get_total_monthly_premium(env, user_address);
```

## Events

- `InsuranceEvent::PolicyCreated`: When a policy is created
- `InsuranceEvent::PremiumPaid`: When a premium is paid
- `InsuranceEvent::PolicyDeactivated`: When a policy is deactivated

## Integration Patterns

### With Remittance Split

Insurance premiums can be automatically allocated from remittance splits:

```rust
let split_amounts = remittance_split::calculate_split(env, total_remittance);
let insurance_allocation = split_amounts.get(3).unwrap(); // insurance percentage

// Use allocation for premium payments
```

### With Bill Payments

Insurance policies can generate corresponding bill entries for premium tracking.

## Security Considerations

- Owner authorization required for all operations
- Input validation for positive amounts
- Policy state validation before operations
- Access control prevents unauthorized modifications
